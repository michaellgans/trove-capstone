## Project Description

Welcome to Trove! Trove is a financial education and children's banking app all rolled into one. It's purpose is to provide a safe environment for parents to teach their kids important lessons on financial literacy. Our team here at Trove recognizes the problems families face today with a lack of access to practical financial education tools and resources, we wanted to do our part to help solve this problem. With Trove, parents can create an account, set up a starting balance, and act as a "bank" for their kids. With our mobile companion app, kids can log in, manage their finances, and take lessons in our Trove Learning Center. Please visit our site at the link above to see what Trove is all about!

Trove was created by a group of students at Atlas School in the City of Tulsa as part of our final capstone project. We had two weeks to complete this project, and we are very proud of what we accomplished! Thank you for visiting Trove!
